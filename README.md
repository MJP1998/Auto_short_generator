## Overview

Welcome to Auto Short/Reels/Tiktok Generator! This project aims to automate the production of short-form videos using AI. Built during my spare time, this project is a creative attempt to leverage AI for generating a large amount of content with minimal effort.

From providing a script and media files, the application takes care of everything:

- Text-to-Speech conversion
- Video editing and effects
- Subtitle generation with forced alignment
- Background music integration

## Flexibility and Extensibility

One of the core philosophies behind this project is flexibility. We understand that automated doesn't have to mean rigid. Therefore, various parts of the video generation can be modified to fit your specific needs.

## Tech Stack üõ†

- **PyDub**: For audio processing
- **MoviePy**: For video editing
- **ElevenLabs API**: For Text-to-Speech conversion
- **PyFoal**: For forced alignment of subtitles
